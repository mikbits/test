Dear Jaime,
Thank you so much for your call. I am happy to talk to you. I would like to tell you about my situation. 
I am working with HSCB as a contractor from past 2 years. I am earning AUD 170000 Base Salary. As I said I will get 3 months contract extension everytime. Its happening for almost 2 years. Next extenson will be in August 2017.

In parallel to Kony interview, I am attending some other interviews also. My current employer is offering a Fixed Term package with AUD 160000 base salary + All employee benefits.( Such as Mobile Bill, Private Health Insurance for Family, Social club membership, concession fitness first etc.. ) + NO TRAVEL :).  This contract is for initially 2 years and will be extended.
I am talking with other employers & its under discussion.

As I said, I have already worked with Kony close to 5 years and I have 13 years of IT experience. I am interested to work with Kony as I feel it is my home company.

As I discussed, I am happy to have a Base package of around AUD 160000 + your offers + 30% TRAVEL.
I know this position will be challenging because , I have to support both Australia & India Team in different Time Zones + Lots of responsibility.

Just have a thought and I wil wait for your reply.

Thanks & Regards
Imran
