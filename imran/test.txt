7. On the 294 of August 2017, he said that he would agree with my decision if I wanted to separate from him. but only after I came out to Australis and stayed with him for a bit and tried to work things out.
8. Tarrived in Australia in February 2018. 1 lived with Juma in Canberra for two months. In that time, he was trying to control me. He refused to provide financial support to me, and twice he threatened to kill himself if I left him.
9. In April 2018, I left Juma and moved away from the ACT. I now have a stable job. and am able to support myself financially
10. On the 14 of Oetober 2018. Juma emailed me, saying he was delaying telling Immigration that we had separated as he wanted to work things out. He told me that as soon as he told Immigration, they would cancel my visa and I would have to return to Afghanistan
11. In December 2018. my Medicare card expired, so I emailed Juma about it. Juma emailed me back stating that I was "now free of him, and that he had notified Immigration that we were separated
12. On the 22" of July 2019, I visited a psychologist in regards to my mental health.
The psychologist noted that after evaluating my depression, anxiety, and stress scales, it indicated that I am currently suffering from extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, as a result of these issues with Jumna, and concern over my ammigration status.
13. On the 14Â° of August 2019, 1 attended Melbourne East Police Station where I made a report with Constable Daniel SANDERSON about what was going on in my life.
14. I fear for my safety. Whilst Juma does not know where I have moved to, or what
1 am doing, I fear his threat that he will release the video he referred to from India. If he sends that to my family it will bring shame upon my family, and I am scared of what might happen if I am deported back to Afghanistan.
